# GitLab CI in conjunction with GitLab Runner can use Docker Engine to test and build any application.
# Docker, when used with GitLab CI, runs each job in a separate and isolated container using the predefined image that is set up in .gitlab-ci.yml.
# In this case we use the latest python docker image to build and test this project.

# before_script is used to define the command that should be run before all jobs, including deploy jobs, but after the restoration of artifacts.

# The YAML file defines a set of jobs with constraints stating when they should be run.
# You can specify an unlimited number of jobs which are defined as top-level elements with an arbitrary name and always
#  have to contain at least the script clause.
# In this case we have only the test job which produces a coverage report and the unittest output (see setup.cfg), and
#  the coverage xml report is moved to the reports directory while the html output is persisted for use by the pages
#  job. TODO: possibly a candidate for refactor / renaming later on.
